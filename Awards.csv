The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating these impacts and bringing inequalities to the fore. This project proposes to study the compounded effects of social and physical vulnerabilities to environmental disasters in Savannah, Georgia, as well as the local policies and practices that promote resilience and recovery. The proposed approach prioritizes social equity and justice by including residents and representatives of Hudson Hill, a lower-income black neighborhood in Savannah, as research partners. Together, the project will identify and co-create new sources of data on disaster vulnerability and resilience and foster broader stakeholder networks within the region. The team also includes researchers from Georgia Tech and Savannah State as well as officials from the City of Savannah Office of Sustainability and the Harambee House, an environmental justice organization. <br/><br/>New forms of community-based data exploration, integration, and mapping are necessary to understand the impacts of compounded environmental disasters faced by residents of Savannah, Georgia, particularly marginalized communities. The project will use these new tools to identify what vulnerability and resilience mean in this context, and then reimagine the resilience networks that these communities need to bounce forward from future disasters. The plan of work includes: 1) socially distanced workshops with communities and organizations; 2) preliminary data collection and archival research on resilience and vulnerability in the area; 3) the development of community-level research protections that bring social justice to data stewardship; 4) the of design community-centered but socially distanced data exploration and mapping techniques; and 5) collaborative grant-writing for the full project proposal. The intellectual merit of the project is to improve our understanding of disaster resilience in marginalized coastal communities and to establish new community-centered methods of data exploration and mapping that prioritize data justice. The following broader impacts are anticipated: 1) to highlight and strengthen existing strategies of disaster resilience in marginalized coastal communities; 2) to model how university partnerships might prioritize social equity and justice as they co-create data and put them into action; 3) to chart and establish a resilience network that can leverage data as planning tools for collective recovery and regeneration; and 4) to model new forms of inclusive and equitable community engaged research under social distancing conditions of COVID-19.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through the partnership of an innovative community-based non-profit dedicated to extending the reach of renewable energy to low-income households and a leading college of science and engineering, we propose to undertake civic engagement, collaborative research, cost analysis and meticulous planning, yielding a project with significant community impact, ready to deploy in the coming year. Most resilience hubs are built in a top-down-fashion by outside experts who determine where these centers will be sited, the services they will offer, and how they will be operated. The project team believes that they can build a better resilience hub if they situate the know-how, talent and potential of those whose needs these sites are intended to address at the center of the project planning. The project team proposes to use community engagement to assess just which services are deemed essential, where the centers can optimally be sited, and how they will in fact be operated in the event of a natural disaster or power shutoff. Absent a crisis, too, this project proactively leverages resilience hubs' clean-power generation to support renewable energy affordability across the community.<br/><br/>This project leverages renewable-energy to create resilience hubs that are economically self-sustaining whether or not threats become crises. The project will pair a community non-profit with a local higher-ed consortium to deliver a family of models that (a) account for energy-use-and-cost across CA's complex of renewable/traditional sources and delivery/storage, (b) are tunable across needs, use-patterns, and community identities, and (c) are publicly available for refinement to serve other geographic, market, and community-identity conditions. The models, in turn, yield strategies to maximize renewable-power resilience hubs' community support:  when the grid is operating normally, hubs generate power used to tilt energy-cost-effectiveness toward renewables. This renewable-energy-shift specifically supports the lowest-income members of our diverse community: those for whom renewable energy is least accessible. In a crisis, resilience hubs can be immediately islanded into an operating power-base from which further crisis-response proceeds. This positive feedback loop is perhaps the project's most important piece: advancing community agency and cohesion via crisis-readiness.   Whether or not the future makes islanding necessary, this project will not be an island. Its models and template for community-driven resilient energy will be available and tunable, to find and deploy analogous positive-feedback loops across our nation's widely-varying communities. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the CIVIC Innovation Challenge program Track B - Resilience to Natural Disasters: Equipping Communities for Greater Preparedness and Resilience to Natural Disasters  through a collaboration between NSF and the Department of Homeland Security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the underlying problem is usually the high and therefore unfeasible cost of operating public transportation or other similar mobility options, operation of a fleet of ride hailing and ride-sharing autonomous vehicles that can also be used for the delivery of food and supplies during a pandemic like the current Covid-19 outbreak is proposed as a feasible solution. This approach of deploying ride Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV) in a transit desert will give residents an on-demand, fast and affordable option of connecting to their job locations, allowing them to have faster and reliable access to work, services and amenities that are otherwise not so easily accessible in reasonable travel periods. The broader impact of this project is to benefit society and advance the desired societal outcome of improving access to jobs from low-mid income neighborhoods in a smart city.  The team will be addressing these needs from both the technological perspective of SAVs as well as from the social science dimension of this technology can both work with the community and be shaped by it.<br/><br/>This project brings together researchers from several disciplines with community partners to plan an affordable, innovative mobility solution that better connects residents to work, critical services, and amenities. The research pilot deployment that will be planned in this project is the use of SAVs in the City of Marysville, Ohio to give its residents a fast and affordable option of connecting to their job locations. The SAVs will be fully electric vehicles with an optimal routing algorithm that will reduce their trip time and energy footprint. The project team will identify demand locations corresponding to affordable housing in Marysville and destination locations corresponding to jobs, determine the geo-fenced area of SAV operation, plan integration with the existing transportation systems for increasing trip range, analyze existing traffic data, build an SAV operation simulation environment for the chosen geo-fenced area and use it to plan a research pilot deployment. The project team will also identify vendors and methods for operation of the pilot. The planning work of this Stage 1 planning project will be compiled into a Stage 2 proposal and will include the plan for the Stage 2 research pilot and how it will be evaluated for success.

The goal is to use smart and connected communication systems to maximize the throughput of people on bike, scooter, and other micromobility modes and minimize physical proximity (when needed) that happens if a group arrives at a red light in any given cycle. With safe and efficient infrastructure, micromobility has the potential to meet a majority of household trip needs, is more affordable than car ownership allowing households to either reduce expenses or allocate more to address housing needs, and is more inclusive for people aged eight to eighty to access their communities more fully.<br/><br/>This work proposes to expand the nation?s only bicycle and driving simulation lab to create dynamic, immersive environments to test new V2X communication with flexible streets and traffic signals that can help municipalities dynamically and quickly change the use of their public right of way due to changing needs, whether due to pandemics, disasters, or just to respond to overall changing community preferences. The team intends to install a network of traffic signals and test the efficacy of this new smart system on streets in Portland, Oregon, in partnership with community stakeholders. The team includes researchers in urban planning, transportation engineering, and computer science from two universities, a private sector vendor of next generation smart traffic signals, and traffic engineers from the cities of Portland (OR) and Utrecht (Netherlands). The results of this work can help fully integrate micromobility into traffic signal systems, in a scalable way, that also gives information to users in ways that help them optimize their travel.

Yet for many, cars are financially out of reach. This project proposes to create a community-based ride-hail program to better connect communities with opportunities. The project team's community partner organization, Vehicles for Change (VFC), will subsidize vehicles to low-income, car-less individuals living in Baltimore. In return, recipients will provide a number of weekly rides to other car-less Baltimore residents to access employment and essential services. The program expands VFC?s existing vehicle subsidy program and connections within the community. This pilot will enable VFC to connect multiple people?rather than single households?to essential services for every car they distribute. If the project team can provide 50 cars for this pilot, the project can enable hundreds of residents to access jobs, healthcare, and educational opportunities.  The project will evaluate the success of community ride-hail using original survey data of program drivers and riders, as well as a control group comprised of those on the waiting list to receive a vehicle from VFC. Measures of success would include employment and earnings data?among others?for drivers, riders, and wait-listed individuals. Program evaluation will significantly advance knowledge by assessing whether the effects of car access could be ?multiplied? by linking subsidized car ownership to a low-cost ride-hail service for other car-less people.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to assess the viability of a community-based ride-hail program that connects low-income residents to jobs and other essential services. This project plans to evaluate the economic and non- economic benefits of this program for both drivers and riders. For drivers, the project team plans to employ a panel- survey to assess the short- and medium-term effects of participating in this program, and compare the results with a control group drawn from the community partners? networks. The team will augment the panel surveys with interviews with drivers and surveys of riders to provide a robust understanding of both qualitative and quantifiable effects of a community ride-hail program to inform best practices for scalable and transferable programs.

This spatial mismatch causes commuter traffic congestion resulting in an annual $29 billion loss to the US economy. Furthermore, many transportation systems were designed decades ago for outdated working and living patterns, often leaving communities without the transportation infrastructure they need. This project addresses these issues through development of a novel ?Community Hub for Smart Mobility? (CHSM) concept. CHSMs will be community-level hubs where residents can access multiple modes of transport such as (e-)bike shares, e-scooters, ride hail, electric vehicle charging stations, and public transit. By utilizing a development process informed by community member input as well as quantitative modeling, CHSMs will directly address the unique transportation needs of community residents. CHSMs will provide more mobility options, increase access to jobs, and improve the overall efficiency of affected transportation systems. The findings from this project will contribute to knowledge not only in the field of transportation, but also participatory design through a novel community-based model.<br/> <br/>The main objective of this project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a Community Hub for Smart Mobility (CHSM) in Austin, TX. This project will design and develop a CHSM in a community identified as impacted by a job/housing spatial mismatch. In Stage 1 of this project, the research team will engage in a co-creation process with residents through community conversations to understand the community?s actual socioeconomic and travel needs. The research team will integrate this feedback with quantitative modeling to predict the unique transportation need of the community. Findings will be shared and revised with community members in an iterative feedback loop until both the community and research team are satisfied with the results. In Stage 2, leveraging the strong partnership with the City of Austin and further community involvement through workshops and surveys, the project will develop and evaluate the CHSM pilot site. The site will not require new construction or development, instead utilizing existing infrastructure, services, and spaces (e.g., situating the CHSM on an unused parking lot). After successful development and implementation of the site, the research team will collect ridership datasets and perform additional surveys, interviews, and focus groups to evaluate the success of the CHSM. The CHSM model has the potential to be implemented in similar communities throughout the US, and the results from this pilot will serve as a model for tackling the job/housing mismatch through community-based mobility solutions nationwide.<br/><br/>This project is in response to Track A ?

However, in sprawling low-density metro areas like Kansas City, unreliable and inefficient transportation services combined with the physical disconnect between residential areas, jobs, and OST opportunities makes these opportunities less accessible to low-income Black and Latinx students. This project?s goal is to increase OST accessibility and awareness and improve system efficiency (e.g., minimize energy consumption) by integrating shared-mobility and mobility-as-a-service options into existing strategic and operational planning tools.<br/><br/>The project entails development, piloting, and evaluation of an Optimized Unified Transportation (OUT) framework that increases awareness of OST opportunities; decreases access disparity through innovative and efficient shared-mobility services, policies, and governance; and incentivizes energy-efficient travel choices. Principal advances include: (i) innovative analysis of student mobility needs and preferences that considers incentives to encourage participation and energy-efficient travel behaviors, (ii) first-of-their-kind travel-demand models that consider social-welfare outcomes, (iii) development and testing of a community-driven OST-opportunity-accessibility framework that includes shared mobility, business models, policies, and governance, and (iv) development and testing of a youth-friendly mobile-application-based technology that incorporates the developed framework. This planning grant will be used to convene a Collaborative Engagement Stakeholder Group (CESG) of community stakeholders, community members, researchers, and civic organizations from the Kansas City metro area. The CESG will engage students (ages 14-18), parents, mobility providers, school and city officials, and employers to identify acceptable shared-mobility solutions, policies, and governance. The CESG will collaboratively develop novel models to understand the impacts of these solutions and incentive strategies on students? travel choices. These solutions and models will be integrated in the OUT framework, optimized through simulation for societal benefit and system efficiency, and implemented in a mobile application for real-world piloting and evaluation.

At the same time, transit agencies strive to expand access while minimizing operational costs and energy consumption. Both of these efforts are often done at scales that limit the ability to do deep, community-engaged planning around housing and transit needs. The goal of this planning grant is to identify gaps in current methods of estimating spatial mismatch from both a stakeholder and community perspective; to explore and document models based on data from the community; and design internal and community-facing frameworks for cross-sector planning tools. Ultimately, this will enable the creation of an analytical framework for addressing spatial mismatch using quantitative and qualitative approaches and develop transparent scenario planning tools. The project brings together community-engaged planning, housing policy and finance, transportation demand and network modeling, transportation energy-efficiency, and data-driven public policy analysis.<br/><br/>This project aims to build community-informed frameworks representing spatial mismatch, which lay the foundation for planning tools that directly integrate with housing and transportation planning processes. Accessibility is a function of the transit quality experienced by individuals (i.e., travel cost, time, reliability) and the proximity and connectivity to jobs that match a worker?s skills and other opportunities. Existing methods to study spatial mismatch force an inferential structure on low-income traveler choice; additionally, they focus on adjustments to transit while treating housing as fixed, and vice versa. Spatial mismatch is neither a binary nor static metric, nor can it be measured by empirics alone: its measurement requires community input in the form of travel patterns, constraints, and needs, as well as the quality of transit connections. This project aims to develop a framework for probabilistic, non-linear path models of spatial mismatch interventions, that allow for qualitative data to inform quantitative metric construction. The community engagement process will allow for identification of gaps in current planning processes and new variables that belong in the calculation of accessibility.

In partnership with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), San Diego?s regional transportation planning agency, and several Community Based Organizations (CBOs), this project will address these shortcomings with a Human Centered Design (HCD) approach to integrate mobility services in disadvantaged communities. In Stage 1, the project will assess the challenges and feasibility of an integrated mobility service with several representative communities. Working with CBOs, the project team will deploy HCD techniques such as day-in-a-life interviews, real-world observations, questionnaires and wearable sensors in several disadvantaged communities. Working with SANDAG, the project team will employ data-driven methodologies including the analysis demographic data, transportation services data, survey data and transportation modeling in these same communities. <br/><br/>This project's primary research objective is to assess the integration of these techniques and their utility in understanding of the needs of disadvantaged communities and in formulating solutions that are both responsive and feasible.

In principle, on-demand ride-sharing services can address these issues by creating an efficient, real-time market?matching drivers with requests. However, the reality for these communities is far different, as the tendency in these services, primarily run by external business owners, is to avoid pickups in low income communities due to safety perception, and lack of trust among users to name a few.  This project focuses on ways to empower the residents within these communities to offer connected mobility solution, and investigate their specific needs and operational constraints that are not currently understood enough. The overarching objective of this work is to create an effective collaboration platform for community partners to communicate their mobility challenges and opportunities with researchers (from engineering, social sciences and computer science), industry partners and policy makers, and to steer these engagements towards a concrete plan for a one-year multi-sided pilot project on customized peer-to-peer mobility solutions for low income communities. The holistic nature of this work includes studies on the societal aspects of connected mobility, and how coherent sociotechnical solutions can be created and how their success can be measured by accompanying social studies.

Microtransit service has been recently launched in Detroit to complement the existing public transit options. Despite the initial success, a salient issue is how to effectively and efficiently utilize microtransit resources to ameliorate spatiotemporal mismatch between employment and housing for low-wage workers. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and increasingly available smart mobility data, the vision of this research project is to create a dynamic routing prediction system based on learning the hourly mobility patterns between jobs and housing. It is designed for the stakeholders (i.e., community advocates and public transport authority) to visualize and forecast the mismatch between employment and housing, which is translated into a dynamic trip demand that can be used to design adaptive routing algorithms to optimize the allocation of microtransit resources and to enhance micromobility via minimizing the rider?s first/last mile. <br/><br/>Currently public transportation with fixed routes and schedules are periodically tweaked and/or augmented to ameliorate the ever-changing spatial mismatch. Despite its long-term effectiveness, it is not sufficiently flexible to adapt to the hourly spatiotemporal variation of jobs-housing mobility patterns primarily from the hourly paid workers. The long-term goal of this project is to work with civic partners in the city of Detroit to (1) design, implement and deploy an AI-assist microtransit system to ameliorate the spatiotemporal mismatch between housing and employment, particularly for the low-wage workers residing in the under resourced neighborhoods; and (2) use geocoded socioeconomic data to identify the community with disparities in mobility and deploy smart mobility technology to reduce the disparities and foster thriving communities. The project?s near-term objective is to leverage and power the existing microtransit service with cutting-edge technology and select a few spatiotemporally mismatched regions in Detroit as the testbed for our smart mobility strategy.<br/><br/>The research innovation is expected to provide immediate, low-cost yet effective public transit solutions that are expected to bring an immediate benefit to the vulnerable communities in Detroit by significantly reducing transit risk, commute time/distance and trip cost. It can be replicated to other US cities to ameliorate the spatiotemporal mismatch between housing and employment.

Such is the case of Cleveland, Ohio, whose once vibrant public transportation system has weakened amidst decades of population loss, suburbanization, the relocation of job hubs away from the central city, and the concentration of affordable housing in neighborhoods marked by segregation and concentrated poverty. The confluence of these factors translate into transportation insecurity for low income households. The vision for this project is to leverage an existing community collaboration tackling the spatial mismatch (Paradox Prize) together with new technologies to take advantage of both public and community-based transportation assets and resources for advancing transportation access, affordability, and security in low-income urban communities. Building on existing data and scholarship, and using technologies to reduce cost and increase efficiency in the current system, this project will identify bottle-necks and inefficiencies in the system to guide new investments and resource allocations to dynamically foster better transportation access, connecting affordable housing and employment opportunities. Additionally, this project will work across transportation, artificial intelligence, social science, cyber-physical systems, smart city, and IoT applications, leading to better connections between low-income communities and access to jobs, affordable housing and wraparound services.<br/> <br/>This project envisions a collaborative effort that will lead to the development of a hybrid transportation system called ?Mobility Improvements to achieve transportation equity in Communities through joint Optimization of Public and Private community-based resources (MICOPP)?, with potential applicability to other urban communities challenged by sprawl and population decline. This planning process will involve active participation of all project stakeholders to make sure that the community needs, available resources, and user and systemic bottlenecks in accessing transportation choices are clearly identified. Using available data, artificial intelligence mechanisms will be developed to jointly optimize public and community-based transportation resources, given safety, availability and affordability constraints with the objective of maximizing the extent that the system serves the community.  Appropriate metrics will be devised to evaluate the effectiveness of MICOPP and study the tradeoffs in investment decisions.

This is a complicated problem; it involves housing, businesses, public and private transportation, infrastructure, jobs and employment opportunities, and essential local services.  To build these indicators, we need to work hand-in-hand with local organizations to learn more about which assets people consider essential, how they move around their neighborhoods, and the constraints on their time and choices.  Historically, these questions have been considered primarily in terms of jobs and affordable housing; the ?access poverty? indicator will ask bigger questions, taking into account the full range of ways in which people need to move around their neighborhoods in order to live their fullest lives.  <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to create a set of indicators to assess the distribution of travel burdens across residential communities within the United States. ?Travel burden? is measured in terms of time or distance spent moving from an origin to a destination. Given the complex nature of movement within cities, the team will account for several modes of transportation as well as detailed breakouts of travel burden across asset categories such as jobs, housing, retail corridors, schools, childcare sites, health clinics, and other places where people want or need to go in order to live productive and connected lives. The research undertaken in the planning phase is to compare available methods for calculating travel burden at the neighborhood level and evaluate georeferenced points-of-interest datasets (as well as conventional employment and housing sources). There are many methodologies for measures of travel burden, these include isochrones, travel time matrices, and other spatial access techniques that use travel data and population characteristics to generate weighted travel costs. These measures can help with benchmarking, identifying specific deficits across communities, and shed light on questions of equity both within cities and across metropolitan areas at scale.

Those without a car are grievously disadvantaged in accessing jobs, health care, and decent groceries. Moreover, housing patterns further limit social mobility, as low-income populations often reside far away from job opportunities and have few efficient public transit options. Ride-hailing services have sometimes helped in providing additional mobility options. But, in general, they have widened inequalities in accessibility, servicing the needs of an affluent population, reducing the revenues of transit authorities, and increasing congestion and emissions. The importance of transit has also being highlighted during the pandemic. This award envisions a future for public transit that meets these mobility challenges for all population segments through the concept of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS). ODMTS combine on-demand services to serve low-density regions with high-occupancy vehicles (buses and/or trains) to travel along high-density corridors. The resulting door-to-door services have been shown to improve convenience, reduce costs, and provide a unique opportunity to expand services and job accessibility in neighborhoods where traditional transit systems have been too costly.<br/><br/>To validate the concept of ODMTS at scale, this civic engagement project explores pilots in Atlanta, the city of Smyrna in Cobb county, and Gwinnett county.  By studying complementary high-impact pilot settings, i.e., transit deserts, cities with no transit systems, counties in need of better connections to a large city, and support for low-income population, the project hopes to create a blueprint for the deployment of a new generation of transit systems across the country. To support these pilots, this award researches the scientific and technological advances to translate the concept of ODMTS into successful pilots. In particular, it explores four research threads to overcome knowledge gaps: (1) the modeling of mobility patterns and their relationship to the built environment, capturing future housing and retail profiles; (2) the joint optimization of mode adoption and network design; (3) the joint optimization of on-demand and recurrent requests; and (4) the modeling of the transit regulatory environment ((ADA, EEO, Title VI). This award adopts a community-driven participatory design, sustained by advanced simulations, visualizations, and metrics to highlight the potential impact of ODMTS on mobility needs and budgets. The blueprint for deploying ODMTS in cities around the country consists of a software pipeline that covers the data analytics, predictive models, optimization technology, mobile applications, and high-performance computing architecture that plan and operate the transit systems.<br/><br/>This project is in response to Track A ?

Affordable-accessible housing for working families is increasingly scarce in the U.S., in particular for small- and mid-sized cities and rural areas. As many small- and mid-sized cities offer only limited public transportation options, low-income residents living in those areas may struggle to access jobs, and critical goods and services. The SMILIES project will deploy SMMs in a mid-sized city to establish the business, operating, and sociodemographic conditions under which SMM can improve accessibility to jobs and essential activities (e.g., schools, shopping, recreation, and health care) for affordable housing communities. Defining such conditions will facilitate the development and evaluation of new, highly effective and cost-effective policies and strategies that will help cities and planning agencies leverage SMM while ensuring equitable distribution of these services.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to determine the degree of impact that SMM services can have on accessibility to jobs and essential activities, household transportation costs, and energy consumption for residents of affordable housing communities in small- and mid-sized cities, and rural areas.

Yet, significant mobility improvements could save residents time and money and improve access to employment, education, food, health care, and other necessary destinations. At the same time, transportation improvements could lead to redevelopment that causes displacement. To advance inclusive and opportunity-rich urban regeneration without displacement, this project envisions a multi-sector and intersectional process to design, test, and institutionalize an innovative community engagement method in a formerly Redlined neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, Valverde, that results in strong community adoption of a technology-supported, community-designed neighborhood mobility system that connects multiple local and regional transportation modes, including traditional transit (bus and rail), micro-transit (e.g. demand responsive shuttles), and micro-modes (e.g. bikes, e-scooters, etc.). This project's approach furthers the development of smart city technologies to promote resident health, prosperity, and welfare through the design and implementation of an equitable and adaptive community-oriented mobility management platform and supportive backend systems that incorporate policies for equity, community ownership, ongoing feedback, rapid system changes, low-barrier participation for micro mobility entrepreneurs, and affordable user subscriptions. While there are many competing transit and mobility apps, none to the project team's knowledge, accommodate all potential modes, local providers, and the ability for ongoing feedback that informs rapid system responses. This approach will also test processes for public institutions and nonprofits to co-construct community engagement processes with residents that are focused on contextually appropriate mobility solutions without triggering displacement. <br/><br/>The proposed system would upgrade and expand the Regional Transit District?s (RTD) existing front-end (e.g., Mobility as a System (MaaS) platform) and back-end technologies to provide affordable subscriptions for mobility packages, community management and ownership opportunities for demand responsive micro-mobilities, and user feedback loops that inform rapid adjustments to bus and shuttle routes and schedules. This project will also create a pilot neighborhood mobility hub to enhance visibility, access, and connectivity among modes; foster community dialog; provide mobility information; and support related entrepreneurial activities, e.g., community bike shops. The engagement plan builds on the Denver Undesign the Redline exhibit, which combined artifacts, storytelling, photos, and interactive activities; and the City?s use of photovoice methods for mobility planning.

There are enormous debates over whether emerging mobility services (like ride-hailing and bikesharing) are complementary or competitive to public transit. This project believes it would be beneficial to experiment with specific forms of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) in the urban core of a congested metropolitan area (e.g. Boston), wherein public transit can focus on high-quality ?mass? transit while allowing for emerging mobility services to complement and feed into public transit. Modern ICTs can provide travelers with a richer set of mobility alternatives that suit individual circumstances and affordability. This project envisions a pilot program that provides low-income workers in targeted communities with mobility service bundles at subsidized costs. Low-income workers can then increase their use of active mobility (which has health benefits) and multi-modal shared services to access more opportunities. The MaaS model also provides tangible benefits for the COVID recovery plan, wherein buses from low-demand routes can be repurposed to better match demand on high-volume routes without eliminating options for car-less individuals on the low-volume routes. This project hopes to learn how preferences for different non-car services vary by time, circumstance, and affordability, in order to extend our findings to the design of a long-term MaaS model that can reverse the trend of rising car ownership in Metro Boston.<br/><br/>This project has already analyzed public transit ridership (from MBTA and Transit app) and commuting flows (from US Census Bureau) to preliminarily identify communities and bus routes that are most suitable for the pilot. Low-income commuters along identified bus routes will be recruited to participate in a stated preference survey, which will used to identify willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-switch for alternative (non-private-car) mobility services. Such alternatives include overlapping commuter rail routes (e.g. Fairmount Line), bikesharing, and mobility-on-demand  (EZRide/ private shuttles/ ride-hailing). Based on the survey, this project will design a randomized controlled trial that provides voucher programs for targeted individuals. Subsidy levels could even be adjusted periodically based on real-time peak-hour public transit overcrowding data provided by Transit app. MaaS vouchers will be distributed among recruits during the pilot phase, and data on real-time mobility choices will be collected for two months.

Given community reliance on utility services and the interconnected and interoperable nature of utility services, infrastructure issues in one neighborhood may have direct and/or cascading effects in others (e.g. a transformer overload in one area may cripple services in distant neighborhoods). Improving natural hazard resilience requires full knowledge of subsurface usage and community interests in them to identify threats and vulnerabilities as well to design effective mitigation strategies. To directly address this challenge the Unification for Underground Resilience Measures (UNUM) project proposes examining subsurface data development, integration and interoperability options in ways envisioned after the 9/11 New York City (NYC) World Trade Center attack. Three-dimensional (3D) integration, viewing, and querying of subsurface data can enable improved risk identification, the implementation of cost-effective mitigation and redundancy measures, and enhanced communications with communities which currently have little access to infrastructure information. Such infrastructure information is typically held in proprietary systems, stored in separate silos, and likely to be in incompatible formats.  Overcoming current data integration barriers requires the design of seamless, interoperable, 3D data storage and visualization systems and a willingness to share data with appropriate security measures in place.

The project supports education and diversity by providing research experiences to diverse students, as well as training CERT volunteers in social media and human-AI teaming.  Findings can help emergency managers better train their volunteers who comb through social media using understandings of the built environment to help machines see new patterns in data.

This question becomes all the more salient when there are information asymmetries (advantages and disadvantages) between groups that prohibit effective cooperation. In the context of Covid-19 it's critical that information asymmetries are overcome to effectively share and pool informational resources. In particular, there is a need to better align the strategic outreach and formal information dissemination activities of municipal governments with citizen-led cooperative groups focused on distribution of local resources. This project considers the latter to be ?networks of care? - individuals coalescing around particular situated vulnerabilities that are revealed or exacerbated by the ongoing global health pandemic. Networks of care, by definition, operate independent from formal government agencies, sometimes because the public sector has failed to care for historically underserved communities. <br/><br/>To study the potential integration of information from networks of care with top-down, centralized, governmental COVID-19 responses, the proposed research-centered pilot project seeks to prototype modular protocols for data creation, analysis, and use - co-designed with care networks, public libraries, and municipal government in Seattle and Boston. These protocols will be flexible to a variety of disasters and crises, and usable in less extreme contexts to build resilience to future pandemics or other crisis events. These protocols will also specifically address privacy protections and data formats, as well as data literacy, collection, storage, cleaning, analysis, visualization, use, and deletion that are necessary for meaningful data exchange.<br/><br/>During the four month planning grant the PI team will be assembled and the research team will collect and assess the relevance of municipal 311, Twitter, and other open data about COVID-19 in Seattle and Boston. Major top-down and bottom-up sources of information about the pandemic will be catalogued, and care networks beyond those named in this planning grant will be prioritized for potential engagement during a full award. Participating care networks will be engaged so as to gather information about the types of data they are collecting, whether they share any of that data and with whom, and their preferences for privacy protections in exchanging information with local governments.   Engagement activities under this planning grant will include remote video-conferencing meetings among the community and city partners, as well as the PI team, senior personnel academic collaborators and consultants. Facilitation will elicit further community-based participants or relevant stakeholders and provide the basis for a future pilot proposal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the most severe ?homework gaps? are experienced by students living in tribal communities, where households often lack reliable broadband connectivity and students experience the highest dropout rates in the nation. It is in this context that this project proposes Digital Backpack (DigiPack), an opportunistic content delivery network and mobile app that proactively uploads, downloads, and stores digital learning material to devices whenever they obtain an Internet connection. DigiPack will enable students? mobile devices to automatically fetch and store digital education content that they can work on offline at home. Content generated and tagged for upload while working offline at home is automatically transferred when Internet connectivity is encountered.  This allows students to make the most of trips to hotspots and allows for more casual interaction with online learning; rather than having to remember a list of all the content that needs to be downloaded, uploaded, and interacted with whenever they are at a hot spot, students can focus on engaging in interactive learning activities (e.g., video calls with a teacher) when connectivity is available and DigiPack automatically handles content that can be engaged with asynchronously. We will partner with STAR School, a public preK-8 charter school located in the southwestern corner of Navajo Nation in Leupp, AZ, to plan and pilot the DigiPack system in Navajo Nation. <br/><br/>This project's vision for research and civic engagement activities focuses on understanding the specific educational content needs of Navajo students and educators in Leupp, AZ. This research will (i) identify the specific educational information needs that DigiPack must support in the Leupp community; (ii) discern where DigiPack CDN nodes and access points should be placed in Leupp for optimal benefit to students and their families; and (iii) co-design the DigiPack mobile app user interface and back end service support to ensure that a deployment is effective and usable.  To this end, the project team will work with a community advisory board (CAB) comprised of Leupp families, educators and ISP operators to guide the design choices for DigiPack interfaces and services such that they best serve the learning needs of the community.

It is a significant problem in Harris County, Texas, where over 14% of households and 23% of children were food insecure at the beginning of 2020. This problem has been further magnified during recent devastating events, including Hurricane Harvey and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It is unclear how the nutritional needs of Houston's vulnerable populations will be addressed amidst multiple disasters, including hurricanes and flooding, COVID-19, economic disruptions, and systemic food insecurity. The Houston Food Bank (HFB) serves the Greater Houston area and collaborates with over 1,500 partners to address families' needs experiencing food insecurity. Disaster preparation and response decisions have been mainly based on incomplete data, human intuition, and pro-bono input from consulting firms. The COVID-19 pandemic has further induced stresses on the organization?s funding and personnel. While the HFB has absorbed and adapted to flooding events and other disasters in the past, it envisions organizational transformation to engage in resilience-building strategies that go beyond current practice. Thus, there is an urgent and critical need for HFB and other such regional food banks to develop and utilize decision support systems that intelligently aid in disaster preparation, response, and performance measurement. Unaddressed, emergency food security supply chains are unlikely to ensure efficient, equitable, and effective distribution of food and related resources.<br/><br/>The project?s goal is to improve the resilience of nonprofit food banks? supply chains by developing and deploying methods and technology systems that enable food banks to fully prepare for disasters, respond to the needs of the communities impacted, and evaluate their performance during disasters. This planning grant involves the preparation of a detailed plan for the deployment of a research-centered socio-technical project to develop and implement decision-making tools that will facilitate integrated disaster planning between HFB and nonprofit agencies involved in food distribution. The specific objectives are to (1) Design organizational resilience indicators and mapping of food equity needs using different census data at low levels of aggregation (e.g., the CDC Social Vulnerability Index) and HFB?s client network,  (2) Design a multilayer, complex network for HFB, consisting of interdependencies both upstream and downstream, (3) Design decision-making tools for disaster management using computational game theory and deep reinforcement learning, and (4) Design the collection of same-day privacy-preserving data from underserved and vulnerable populations over a potentially disrupted communication infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over two years later, with families and businesses still recovering, the event offers an opportunity to enhance resilience of area communities and other places worldwide which are increasingly vulnerable to floods. The Hawaiian Islands comprise a model social-ecological system of diversity in culture, rainfall, and ecosystems. Traditionally, Hawaiian food security was underpinned by oversight of water resources built across generations, but local knowledge alone can no longer encompass changes in rainfall, species invasion, and shifting land use. This proposal offers a model to restore capacity for local stewardship of waterways through scientific partnerships to enhance monitoring and communication tools. This project will enhance social and ecological community resilience to increasing flood risk through: 1) Collaborative Research - Working with community members to integrate diverse methods and knowledge of watershed change to enhance local level stream management; 2) Piloting restoration and stream clearing; 3) Monitoring and Communication to improve availability of historical and real-time hydrometeorological data to understand flood hazards, and promote connectedness around extreme events; and 4) Community Education and Training offering educational materials to enhance holistic resilience to future disasters. Project partners include seven community non-profits, the county disaster planning and response agency, three university faculty specializing in water - from atmosphere to groundwater - and one social scientist native to the study area, along with a community lead experienced in indigenous stewardship. <br/><br/>Project goals and scope of research include interviews and focus groups with community members, piloting stream restoration through invasive species removal, installation of real-time weather stations to monitor rainfall, development of a communication web portal, and course for community education that will include in-person on-site learning and video instruction.  Researchers and community members will together integrate elders? knowledge, and historic stream data to generate research questions, place monitoring stations, and investigate hydrological responses during extreme rainfall events. This project provides a model for collaboration between university scholars, local non-profits, and indigenous community members to enhance research, infrastructure, and communication; provide monitoring, observation capability and training opportunities and enhance local resilience to climate change. This proposal will also contribute to understanding of cultural, social and contextual aspects of resilience; model collaborative processes to generate and assess locally relevant indicators of resilience over time; while testing applications of hydrological science and communication technology to climate change adaptation and planning.

Prior research has found that low income households suffer disproportionately from disasters and recover less quickly than other residents. Financial resilience?the ability to recover from an economic shock?underpins other aspects of recovery and is a necessary condition for broader urban disaster resilience. Despite this, it is an under-investigated aspect of climate adaptation. While the problem has been identified, actionable research into solutions is scarce. The proposed project is designed to fill this gap. This project's specific objective is to demonstrate that increasing the financial resilience of low and moderate income (LMI) households (both homeowners and renters) in New York City presents an essential element of resilience strategies especially in response to increasing urban flooding risk.  <br/><br/>This project, across both phases, will be comprised of three inter-related research components: (1) designing a pilot policy intervention; (2) improving disaster financial literacy among households and capacity among city staff; and (3) developing a metric of financial resilience to disasters, especially for LMI households. The work will be a joint effort between the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania, the New York City Mayor?s Office of Resiliency, and the Center for NYC Neighborhoods, as well as other partner researchers. The work will be informed by an advisory board with deep expertise on this challenge. The pilot program will be a public-private partnership to demonstrate the importance of financial resiliency as a complement to other more typically researched approaches - since LMI households tend to have insufficient savings, can be locked out of credit, cannot afford standard insurance, and suffer disproportionately more longer term damage.  Phase 1 of this project will be a period of stakeholder engagement, involving scoring policies against chosen criteria, to identify the most promising solution for piloting in Phase II:  (1) parametric microinsurance, (2) premium reductions for low-cost flood mitigation, (3) a local flood insurance affordability program, (4) community assistance plus a high-deductible NFIP policy, (5) right-sizing insurance coverage, and (6) community-based insurance. The second project component will be developing disaster financial literacy tools and building expertise on this topic among civic partner organizations through specific products and engagement strategies. Prior work has found that increasing financial literacy makes individuals better able to withstand shocks. The third component will develop a metric of financial resilience to disasters for LMI households. This metric will be designed to inform the broader academic literature, which lacks an established approach to measurement of this specific concept, as well as be practically useful to city programs. Constructing the metric will draw on city data, as well as a survey of LMI households. <br/><br/>This project is in response to Track B - CIVIC Innovation Challenge - Resilience to Natural Disasters a collaboration with NSF and the Department of Homeland Security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus is to develop economic activity that will support resiliency in areas experiencing disasters. Communities in coastal Louisiana have suffered crippling and repeated damage from hurricanes, coastal sea-level rise, offshore oil spills, and channelization of marshes for oil and gas exploration, production and distribution, and are increasingly vulnerable to Atlantic hurricanes with Gulf water warming. Within this complex context of risks, COVID-19 has also threatened the health of coastal community residents and forced layoffs of hundreds of coastal and support industry workers employed by the offshore oil and gas industry. A key element in the transition to new, greener industries and occupations is building on and adapting existing skills and infrastructure, and transferring these skills to the next generation. This project engages twelve diverse communities along the Louisiana coast in a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) process to generate and select ideas for economic activities, products and services that can be produced by the existing workforce while preserving the environmental integrity of the coast and its cultures. <br/><br/>The proposed project advances fundamental understanding of how to align skills and knowledge development for personnel trained in the offshore oil and gas exploration/production industry using a partnered approach to generating and assimilating knowledge from diverse stakeholders to create sustainable economic choices and a diverse economic income structure for more resilient livelihoods, community stability and disaster resiliency.

Native American communities, state and national agencies, university researchers, and other stakeholders have contributed to recovery efforts and initiated the difficult process of fundamentally changing existing approaches to building resilient communities and landscapes by learning from Pueblo partners. Specifically, Pueblo communities have conveyed to the research team that they can benefit from designing and building their own sensor networks, as opposed to using commercial off-the-shelf sensors, which represents a paradigm shift and a novel approach to community resilience. This paradigm shift presents a new approach to enhancing community resilience where the sensor solutions are designed and built by the community. In this proposal, Pueblo communities will design, build and implement their own Low-Cost Efficient Wireless Intelligent Sensors (LEWIS). These self-built distributed sensor networks will inform communities of trends and thresholds in landscapes that can assist in managing wildfires and providing early warning when fires and floods occur.  This project's long-term vision is to develop a Nationwide community of practice that shares ideas, designs, and applications for resilience in Tribal communities by co-developing capacity and communications related to sensor networks and decision- support tools. This collaboration will lead directly to new resilience indices, a pilot demonstration of an environmental sensor network, a blueprint for incorporating sensor data into decision-making platforms, and strategies for building community resilience. The vision for this pilot project is to create an example that catalyzes a user community of sensor technologies that contributes to increased resilience in Tribal communities. In addition, this project will deliver a curriculum module on sensor technologies for environmental monitoring to high school students at the Santa Fe Indian School that demonstrates new, exciting technologies, and introducing career opportunities in STEM.

Resilience in the face of these dangerous events requires a variety of changes from personal behaviors to regional policies and infrastructure. Despite the high stakes, change in this realm has proven slow and illusive. This proposal addresses this challenge by providing a means for emergency officials, incident commanders and community members to explore alternative responses to different hazards through the use of scenario-based games. These games, often referred to as ?digital twins?, probe the interdependencies between the networks of transportation, lifeline infrastructures of water, power, and communications, and organizational plans that need to align for effective response to urgent hazards. An interdisciplinary team of designers, civil engineers, policy experts, and community members  will create social games based on wildfire, traffic and communication simulations. <br/><br/>The project's inter-disciplinary team will partner with organizations in Oakland and Bolinas, California who are seeking new ways to increase the ability of their communities to respond to wildfire evacuation events. Together, the team will co-develop the social games with the purpose of surfacing local insight, knowledge, and feedback. These games are far more than entertainment, rather, they are constructed as prototypes that are used to support a cycle of mutual learning between the community and the researchers. In doing so, the team will create more resilient communities by using these instruments in a novel way to address the long-standing, classic problem of the transition of cognition to action. This project will offer new lines of research into more humanized data simulations, rapid, and iterative policy exploration and use of design at a systems scale.

The project seeks to use innovative ecosystems of smartphone based technologies to grow and sustain communities of bicycle commuters that ride to work together in both ad hoc and regular groups, improving mobility while working around limitations of current transit infrastructure in Los Angeles, a region ranked as having the highest commute-related worker stress levels in the nation.  This project uses smartphone-based participatory sensing, photojournaling, ad hoc group route planning, and dynamic visualizations suitable for community spaces that together help individuals overcome barriers to bike commuting, including perceived safety risks. The proposed solution works around and intends to inspire the necessarily slower changes to city infrastructure needed to address the ?spatial mismatch? of housing and workplace locations, addressing the effects of that mismatch through gains in transportation ?satisfaction? over the otherwise dominant lens of ?efficiency.?   In this planning effort, the project team of university researchers and community organizations will work with residents, workers, employers, and service organizations to address research questions necessary to prepare a prototype implementation for our study area, including gathering information on bicycling ownership and practices, barriers to bicycling to work, costs of transportation and housing, employer support for bikeshare programs, willingness to make tradeoffs to ride in groups, existing community relationships and structures, collective identity dynamics, smartphone penetration, and the potential role of smartphone based participatory sensing technology. Results of this project will include the research agenda and evaluation metrics for a Stage 2 project that demonstrates how mobile smartphone support for group commuting by bicycle can turn a commute into a safe, productive, fulfilling and sustainable time investment, reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and directly address many of the challenges posed in the program solicitation.<br/><br/>This project combines community-led training with a modest but innovative ecosystem of cloud-supported smartphone tools, such as privacy-preserving automatic route documentation, data-driven ad hoc group formation and planning of emergent group bike routes, facilitated digital journaling and exhibition that involves groups and the larger community in journaling their process of ?becoming a bicyclist?, evolving digital self-portraits of the groups (and larger biking community) available on mobile devices and the web, and a public feed of de-identified safety and satisfaction incidents.  Critical to our approach is this use of creative expression and self-documentation to enhance feelings of identity and sustain the groups brought together by the systems we envision.  The collaboration addresses spatial mismatch by demonstrating that a cycling based approach can treat the ""mismatch"" ?symptoms? more productively and more immediately than the underlying structural conditions and at lower cost by making bike-to-work a compelling and satisfying alternative.  Then, this experience can drive more significant infrastructural change to support biking itself and contribute to the civic conversation around better models for full commute and ?first mile / last mile? public transit options in the longer term.
